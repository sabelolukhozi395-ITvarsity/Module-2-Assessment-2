                <h3>CHICKEN LICKEN</h3>
                <p>Chicken Licken is a South African fast-food fried chicken restaurant chain.[4] The company had a 5% share of South Africa's fast food market in 2010, tying with McDonald's.[5] According to a case study published by the Henny Penny Corporation in 2011, Chicken Licken is the largest non-American-owned fried chicken franchise in the world.</p>
                <p>Chicken Licken was founded in South Africa by George Sombonos, the son of a Greek immigrant restaurant owner.[6][8][9] Sombonos learned the restaurant trade in the 1970s at the Dairy Den, his father's restaurant in Ridgeway, a suburb in the southern Inner City region of Johannesburg.</p>
